    options: ["c", "d", "e", "f"],
    correctAnswer: "c",
    explanation:
      "In the given lattice, c is the least upper bound of {a, b} as it is the smallest element above both a and b.",

    question: "What is the greatest lower bound (GLB) of {x, y} in this lattice?",
    diagram: "/images/lattice2.png", 
    options: ["z", "w", "u", "v"],
    correctAnswer: "w",
    explanation:
      "The greatest lower bound of {x, y} is w, as it is the largest element below both x and y.",

    question: "Which lattice type is depicted in the diagram?",
    diagram: "/images/lattice3.png",
    options: ["Distributive lattice", "Modular lattice", "Boolean lattice", "Complete lattice"],
    correctAnswer: "Distributive lattice",
    explanation:
      "The given lattice satisfies the distributive property: a ∧ (b ∨ c) = (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c), making it a distributive lattice.",

    question: "Find the complement of the element 'a' in this Boolean lattice.",
    diagram: "/images/lattice4.png",
    options: ["b", "c", "d", "e"],
    correctAnswer: "b",
    explanation:
      "In a Boolean lattice, the complement of 'a' is 'b' because their meet (∧) is 0, and their join (∨) is 1.",

    question: "What type of lattice is illustrated here?",
    diagram: "/images/lattice5.png",
    options: ["Complete lattice", "Bounded lattice", "Modular lattice", "Boolean lattice"],
    correctAnswer: "Bounded lattice",
    explanation:
      "The lattice has both a greatest element (1) and a least element (0), which makes it a bounded lattice.",

      "Power set of a set with inclusion relation",
      "Set of integers under multiplication",
      "Set of real numbers under division",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Power set of a set with inclusion relation",
    explanation:
      "The power set of a set with inclusion relation is a lattice because every subset has a least upper bound (union) and a greatest lower bound (intersection).",

    question: "What is the least upper bound (LUB) of {2, 3} in divisors of 12?",
    options: ["6", "12", "2", "3"],
    correctAnswer: "6",
    explanation:
      "In the divisors of 12, the least upper bound of {2, 3} is 6 because 6 is the smallest divisor of 12 that is divisible by both 2 and 3.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Which property is required for a set to be a lattice?",
    options: [
      "Distributive property",
      "Existence of least upper and greatest lower bounds",
      "Associativity",
      "Commutativity",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Existence of least upper and greatest lower bounds",
    explanation:
      "A lattice requires that every pair of elements have a least upper bound (LUB) and a greatest lower bound (GLB). This is the defining property of a lattice.",

    question: "What is the greatest lower bound (GLB) of {4, 6} in divisors of 12?",
    options: ["2", "4", "6", "1"],
    correctAnswer: "2",
    explanation:
      "In the divisors of 12, the greatest lower bound of {4, 6} is 2 because it is the largest divisor of 12 that divides both 4 and 6.",
